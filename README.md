# divisibility_check_by_7

A simple RUST program to check if a given number is divisible by 7




Comparision of output of the program with that of a proper number theory calculator (GP/PARI) is attached for reference. GP is a great number theory calculator that uses PARI library and can handle very big numbers. The code that I wrote is limited to i64
